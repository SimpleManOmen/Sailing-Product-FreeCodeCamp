        <h2>Free Energy</h2>
         <p>Free energy has long been the goal of such people as Nikola Tesla and Stan Meyer. There have been many rumors of government and big corporations shutting down anyone who have discovered a new way of creating free energy. But they have never been able to stop the wind. The wind, which you can use to travel the world and generate electricity.</p>

         <h2 id="travel">Travel The World</h2>
         <p>Travel can be so expensive! Especially if you are travelling overseas. But with your very own sailboat you can travel across the globe while never paying for the first plane ticket nor any hotels. The cost savings quickly add and you always have the world's greatest swimming pool outside your door.

        <div class="box">
            <h2 id="home">Home is where the heart is.</h2>
            <p>And you'll quickly find that your heart is on the boat. Long gone are the days of ruffing it at sea. Some even choose to live in their boats full time, whether at sea or just docked at their local marina. Complete with kitchen and all the amenities. Get rid of that mortgage and have a home that can go where you go.

            <h2 id="social">Friends & Family</h2>
            <p>Many families are now living as "cruisers" traveling the world with their kids, home schooling and giving them the greatest of educations and experiences. Some families will meet up from port to port and the children develop life long friends while getting the see the world. You'll quickly find that the cruising community is a tight knit and supportive family.</p>
